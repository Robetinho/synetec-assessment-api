Hi there

I DI'd the service and the AppDBContext
Changed the amount to a decimal so it could handle pence like in the example question
Wrote some unit tests for the Service.CalculateAsync method
Added some error handling for badrequest

I wasn't sure what the in-vogue way to mock the DBContext with EF was and no doubt there is a better way that what i've done - never mind

Hopefully i didn't miss anything!
